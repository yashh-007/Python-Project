List Data Structure Implementation

Project Overview

This project implements a custom List data structure in Python, providing a comprehensive set of methods for manipulating and interacting with lists.

Features

- Dynamic memory allocation for efficient storage
- Support for basic operations like insertion, deletion, and search
- Advanced methods for sorting, reversing, and merging lists
- Error handling for invalid operations and edge cases

Implemented Methods

Basic Operations

- insert(index, value): Insert an element at a specified index
- delete(index): Remove an element at a specified index
- search(value): Find the index of a specific element
- get(index): Retrieve an element at a specified index
- set(index, value): Update an element at a specified index

Advanced Operations

- sort(): Sort the list in ascending order
- reverse(): Reverse the order of the list
- merge(other_list): Merge two lists into a single list
- split(index): Split the list into two separate lists at a specified index

Utility Methods

- size(): Get the number of elements in the list
- is_empty(): Check if the list is empty
- clear(): Remove all elements from the list

Installation
